@deftypefn {Function} {int} cl_setvar (cl_var_t *@var{tab}, char *@var{zeile}, long @var{flags}, 
cl_ulist_t ** @var{unknowns})

cl_setvar works as if @var{zeile} was a line in a configuration
file. It looks in @var{tab} for the variable name.

@var{flags} is a bitfield consisting of the following bits:
@table @bullet
@item CL_GET_NOINCLUDE
If this bit is set @code{include}- and @code{includestanza}-statements
in @var{handle} will be ignored.
@end table

If @var{unknowns} is not @code{NULL} then the pointer it points to
will be the start of a list of unknown variables (basically this
are variables set in the stanza which are not found in @var{tab}).
The list is dynamically allocated, use @code{cl_free_unknowns} to
deallocate the memory. @xref{cleaning up, cl_free_unknowns}.

This function returns 0 if successful and some other value if not.
@end deftypefn
