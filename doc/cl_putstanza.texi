@deftypefn {Function} {int} cl_file_t (cl_file_t *@var{handle}, cl_var_t *@var{tab}, const char *@var{stanza}, 
	long @var{flags}, cl_ulist_t *@var{unknowns})

@code{cl_putstanza} writes @var{tab} to the configuration file 
@var{handle} into the stanza @var{stanza}. It tries hard to
do the right thing (especially it preserves any variables found
in the it doesn't know about).

But there a things @code{cl_putstanza} can or will not handle:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{include}- and @code{includestanza}-statements are
ignored (it would be hard to do that right, and i don't see a really
good reason for it).
@item Variables in @var{tab} without the @code{CL_MAY_SAVE} flag
set will not be saved (this means: if you want to save all variables
all variables need that flag). If the variable is already found
in the stanza @var{stanza} it will be preserved (this means: it's 
not enough to leave out the @code{CL_MA_SAVE} flag to delete a 
variable. In fact it's impossible to delete a variable at this
time).
@end itemize

All variables in @var{unknowns} will be saved. 

To state it clearly: At the moment there is no way to remove a
variable from the configuration file.

Returns 0 if successful, other values is unsuccessful.
