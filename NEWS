New in version 0.4.5:

* a new type, bitfield, is supported.

* Stanzanames in brackets also work ([stanza]).

* "var ~= value" to force the interpretation of that value
  (cl_getstanza and friends, not cl_assign oder cl_setvar).

* "append var = string-to-append" now supported, for strings
  and directory names.

* "override var = new-value" now supported, for bitfields and lists
  (otherwise the new value would be "or"ed or appended to the old 
  value).

* compiles on BeOS.

(0.4.4 left out)

New in version 0.4.3:

* new function cl_setvar. Treats a string as if it was a line in a
  configuration file.

* $var=xxx assignments in a configuration file are now sent through
  text interpretation ($PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH). Doesn't do ~
  interpretation (pwd.h interface is broken, IMNSHO).

* a shared library can be build.

* numerical values with suffixes are recognized (especially k
  == kilo/1024 and m == mega/1024^2).

* minor bugfixes.

NEW in version 0.4.2: 

* minor bug fixes and portability enhancements.
